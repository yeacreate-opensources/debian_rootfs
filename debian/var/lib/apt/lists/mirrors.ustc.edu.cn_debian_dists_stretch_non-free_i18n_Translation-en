Description-en: client to donate unused CPU cycles to distributed.net
 Donate your extra CPU cycles to a worthy cause!
 .
 distributed.net started in 1997 as a project whose purpose was to win a
 series of contests sponsored by RSA Data Security Inc., to crack their RC5
 encryption by brute-force methods. These contests were meant to show
 governments of nations such as the United States, who limit exports or
 use of cryptography, that the standards allowed are too weak for general
 use.
 .
 Since this time, distributed.net's focus has changed from solely
 cracking RSA's RC5 and DES projects to working on more diverse
 distributed computing problems.
 .
 The ongoing projects are RC5-72 and Optimal Golomb Rulers (28-mark), the
 latter of which has practical applications in science. There are also a
 number of other projects which are either periodic or upcoming. You may
 choose which project you wish to participate in.
 .
 Installing this package will allow unused CPU cycles on your computer to
 contribute to cracking the code. There should be no noticeable slowdown of
 your system, since the client runs niced, and only uses CPU time when
 your computer would otherwise be idle.

 its use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 Genesis Plus GX is a Sega 8/16 bit emulator focused on accuracy and
 portability. Initially ported and developed on Gamecube / Wii consoles
 only through libogc / devkitPPC, it is now available on many other platforms
 through various frontends.
 .
 The source code, originally based on Genesis Plus 1.3 by Charles MacDonald, has
 been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to initial goals and design, in
 order to improve the accuracy of emulation, implementing new features and
 adding support for extra peripherals, cartridge & systems hardware.
 .
 The result is that Genesis Plus GX is now more a continuation of the original
 project than a simple port, providing very accurate emulation and 100%
 compatibility with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master System, Game Gear
 & SG-1000 released software (including all unlicensed or pirate known dumps),
 also emulating backwards compatibility modes when available.

Description-en: Multilingual software speech synthesizer
 Mbrola is Thierry Dutoit's phonemizer for multilingual speech synthesis. The
 various diphone databases are distributed on separate packages, but they
 must be used with and only with Mbrola because of license matters. Read the
 copyright for details.
 .
 Mbrola itself doesn't provide full TTS. It is a speech synthesizer based on
 the concatenation of diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input,
 together with prosodic information (duration of phonemes and a piecewise linear
 description of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear),
 at the sampling frequency of the diphone database.
 .
 Use Mbrola along with Freephone, cicero or espeak to have a complete
 text-to-speech in English.

 .
 The Computer Aided Drug Discovery (CADD) Pipeline is a workflow
 environment designed to support molecular dyanmics simulations
 and virtual screening experiments for in silico drug discovery,
 with a special focus on supporting the use of the Relaxed
 Complex Scheme. It includes web based access to applications
 such as NAMD, AutoDock, PDB2PQR, APBS, MGLToos and couples them
 in a flexible and scalable fashion through cloud computing.
 It is developed as a standalone application, using Vision
 (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=MGLTools#Vision) as
 the backend engine for visual programming and workflow execution.
 The scientific applications are made accessible through CADD using
 Opal Web services (https://www.nbcr.net/pub/wiki/index.php?title=Opal)
 for scalable and distributed computation.
 .
 The workflow components of the CADD pipeline are currently released
 as Vision networks packaged for specific processes in a modular
 fashion. These modules may be coupled at ease for more complex
 processes. In the future, they may also be accessible from workflow
 repositories such as MyExperiment.org, and from AutoDockTools.  The Opal
 services used in the CADD workflow may be accessed using programmatic
 access, the Opal Server Dashboard or other workflow clients such as
 Kepler, VisTrails or Taverna through Opal plugins available at Opal
 Sourceforge website (http://opal.nbcr.net).
 .

Package: org-mode-doc
Description-md5: ef7aa3101c7c42ac8598e581fdc41baf
Description-en: keep notes, maintain ToDo lists, and do project planning in emacs
 Org-mode is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, and
 doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.
 .
 Org-mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
 information about projects as plain text. Org-mode is implemented on
 top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
 large files well structured. Visibility cycling and structure editing
 help to work with the tree. Tables are easily created with a built-in
 table editor. Org-mode supports ToDo items, deadlines, time stamps,
 and scheduling. It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda. Plain
 text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet messages,
 BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects. For printing and
 sharing of notes, an Org-mode file can be exported as a structured
 ASCII file, HTML, and LaTeX.

Package: proj-rdnap

Description-en: RDNAP grid correction files for PROJ.4
 Kadaster and Rijkswaterstaat CIV, working together under the name RDNAP,
 developed RDNAPTRANS™2008, the precise and official transformation
 between ETRS89 and the dutch national horizontal and vertical coordinate
 reference systems the Stelsel van de Rijksdriehoeksmeting (RD) and the
 Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP). A ‘simplified’ procedure has been
 developed which uses a NTv2-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and RD as well as a VDatum-grid for the transformation between ETRS89
 and NAP. This ‘simplified’ procedure has the following limitations:
 .
  1) The rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid can only give identical results to
     RDNAPTRANS™2008 within 1 millimeter at ground level onshore and at
     mean sea level offshore. The horizontal deviation is approximately
     1 millimeter per 50 meter height difference from ground level or mean
     sea level.
  2) An exception to 1) is the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid. Transformation results within cells of the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
     that are intersected by the border of the RDNAPTRANS™2008 correction
     grid can result in deviations of up to 20 centimeter.
  3) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid cannot be used to determine deflections
     of the vertical. For this the NLGEO2004 geoid model has to be used.
  4) The naptrans2008 VDatum-grid is referenced to the Bessel-1841 ellipsoid
     and cannot be used stand-alone, it has to be used in combination with
     the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid.
 .
 Taking into account the limitations listed above, the rdtrans2008 NTv2-grid
 and naptrans2008 VDatum-grid can be used as an alternative to
 RDNAPTRANS™2008 to transform geographic ETRS89-coordinates to
 projected RD-coordinates with grid correction applied and NAP-heights.
 .
 Note that, although the resulting RD/NAP and ETRS89 coordinates from the
 transformation will be correct, geographic Bessel-1841 coordinates will
 differ in both procedures and should only be considered as an intermediate
 result.

 Allows conversion to and from data in Javascript object notation (JSON)
 format. This allows R objects to be inserted into
 Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code and allows R programmers to read
 and convert JSON content to R objects. This is an alternative to rjson
 package. Originally, that was too slow for converting large R objects to
 JSON and was not extensible. rjson's performance is now similar to this
 package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This package uses
 methods and is readily extensible by defining methods for different classes,
 vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for
 deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally share
 the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many additional
 options to allow customizing the generation and processing of JSON
 content. This package uses libjson rather than implementing yet another
 JSON parser. The aim is to support other general projects by building
 on their work, providing feedback and benefit from their ongoing development.

 With minimal preparation of a plain-text, (UTF-8) file, using its native
 markup syntax in your text editor of choice, SiSU can generate various
 document formats (most of which share a common object numbering system for
 locating content), including plain text, HTML, XHTML, XML, EPUB, OpenDocument
 text (ODF:ODT), LaTeX, PDF files, and populate an SQL database with objects
 (roughly paragraph-sized chunks) so searches may be performed and matches
 returned with that degree of granularity: your search criteria is met by these
 documents and at these locations within each document. Object numbering is
 particularly suitable for "published" works (finalized texts as opposed to
 works that are frequently changed or updated) for which it provides a fixed
 means of reference of content. Document outputs also share semantic meta-data
 provided.
 .
 SiSU also provides concordance files, document content certificates and
 manifests of generated output.
 .
 man pages, and interactive help are provided.
 .
 Dependencies for additional features are taken care of in sisu related

Package: snaphu
Description-md5: 6ac13ac4c3384f0d55c3268461aa73d3
Description-en: Statistical-Cost, Network-Flow Algorithm for 2D Phase Unwrapping
 Two-dimensional phase unwrapping is the process of recovering
 unambiguous phase data from a 2-D array of phase values known only
 modulo 2pi rad.
 .
 There are many applications, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fringe pattern analysis, tomography
 and spectroscopy, which as part of their fundamental operation depend
 upon the extraction of a phase signal from their input image. Usually
 the phase is available in a form that suffers from 2-pi phase jumps
 due to the use of the mathematical arctangent function, which produces
 an inherently wrapped output. This wrapped phase is unusable until the
 phase discontinuities are removed.
 .
 SNAPHU is an implementation of the Statistical-cost, Network-flow
 Algorithm for Phase Unwrapping particularly suitable for SAR
 interferometry applications. This algorithm poses phase unwrapping as
 a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation problem, the
 objective of which is to compute the most likely unwrapped solution
 given the observable input data. Because the statistics relating the
 input data to the solution depend on the measured quantity, SNAPHU
 incorporates three built-in statistical models, for topography data,
 deformation data, and smooth generic data. The posed optimization
 problem is solved approximately with use of network-flow techniques.
 .
 As SNAPHU uses an iterative optimization procedure, its execution time
 depends on the difficulty of the interferogram. In single-tile mode
 the required memory is on the order of 100 MB per 1,000,000 pixels in
 the input interferogram.

 or deleting such features.
 .
 From a technical point of view WFS-T is a Web Service API in front
 of a spatial database. TinyOWS is deeply tied to PostgreSQL/PostGIS
 because of this.
 .
 TinyOWS implements strictly OGC standards and pass successfully all
 WFS OGC CITE tests (and even beta ones).
 .
 TinyOWS is part of MapServer Suite, but provided as a distinct module
 (i.e you could use it in conjunction with MapServer and MapCache, or
 as a standalone app). But both MapServer and TinyOWS could use the same
 configuration file, if you want to (or native TinyOWS XML config file).

Package: tome
Description-md5: 9efcf47839037501aa7357051f1287d3
Description-en: single-player text-based roguelike dungeon simulation game
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

Description-en: Threaded USENET news reader, based on rn (4.0 beta test)
 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.  In this case you will also need to install
 an appropriate 'inews' package for local posting.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.
